# Project 2 - Data Visualization
# Tsunami Dashboard

### Introduction
We are interested in developing a dashboard to visualize tsunami data for events that occurred during 2000-2020.
We chose tsunamis because most natural disaster dashboards focus on earthquakes. While tsunamis are usually caused by earthquakes, we thought it would be interes/ng to look at data that is tsunami-specific, including how far away effects were observed compared to the source loca/on, water height, injuries, and damages.
